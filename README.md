### Created by Group 2 for DSCI/LIB 350M at the University of Oregon

**Course:** Humanities Research Data Management (DSCI/LIB 350M) at University of Oregon

**Date of Course:** Fall 2025

**Course Description:** 

This course provides students with theoretical and practical experience in collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing humanities data (images, video, sound, text, maps, etc.) gathered from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). With the goal of building thematic digital collections as researchers, students will learn digital methodologies focusing on the technical, legal, ethical, and social aspects of working with humanities research data throughout its curation lifecycle. This includes hands-on experience finding, assessing, organizing, and reformatting data; creating and remediating descriptive metadata; evaluating and determining copyright and licensing; writing a data management plan using the standards set by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and sharing thematic research digital collections using GitHub and the opensource platform CollectionBuilder (Taken by Kate Thornhill’s Syllabus)

**Collection Title:** Native American Art of Oregon

**Collection Description:** 
Our digital collection is focused on the topic of Native Americans in the contemporary state of Oregon and the greater Pacific Northwest. Our collection is themed around artworks created by Natives among various tribes in these areas with the main goal of amplifying their voices and perspectives. Our perceived main audience is Native groups who could use this to support cultural preservation or community education about their prominence and presence in the Pacific Northwest. Another intended audience for this collection is researchers such as anthropologists, art historians, or historians who are interested in analyzing Native art or focused on re-patriation of Native objects.

**Description of Data Management Plan (DMP):**
Our Data Management Plan highlights our project description from a technical standpoint as well as each of our group members’ data management responsibilities. The plan also describes expected data types, data formats, data storage and preservation strategies. We provide a data dictionary as well as access to our metadata application plan.
