# Data Management Plan
## Group 2
## Conner Birdwell, Quinn Enyart, Hunter Everton, David Horwitz, Anna Wallin

### Project Description

This digital collection is focused on the topic of Native Americans in the contemporary state of Oregon and general Pacific Northwest region. The collection is themed around artworks created by Natives among various tribes in these areas. The goal is to show their creativity and cultural traditions in a way that reflects their voices and perspectives. The artwork presented comes from various media, from textiles to wooden sculptures and pencil sketches. The topic of Native Americans in Oregon was due to the personal connection some of our group members have to Native American communities out East. We chose to theme our collection around Native art as we felt that documentation of Native American history and their lives has been centered on the colonial documenters rather than the Native Americans being documented themselves. In many museum exhibits or history projects, Native Americans are often presented through the eyes of outsiders. We thought that collecting the objects of Native Americans directly centers the Native Americans themselves and let the objects they created speak for themselves. The GLAMs that we have used for our collection so far include: The Portland Art Museum, Hallie Ford Museum of Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History.

For our project we used Github sheets and the CollectionBuilder template to create our project website. Many of the documents and our metadata we organized and created through a shared Google drive using the various programs Google offers, like Google docs for creating documents, Google sheets for creating spreadsheets, and Google slides for creating presentations.

Our collection has a couple of groups or audiences that would be interested in reusing our collection, those being Native Americans, researchers such as anthropologists or art historians, and anyone from the general public interested in these images. Our collection is a benefit to these groups as we have synthesized objects from different GLAMs which could act as the beginning to a bigger project collecting all artistic objects created by Native Americans in Oregon and the surrounding Pacific Northwest.

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Group Member | Role | Responsibilities |
|--------------|------|------------------|
| Quinn | Project Manager | Quinn was responsible for managing the Google Drive folder, leading and coordinating communication, and submitting all our group projects. |
| David | Collection Development Manager | David made the final call about what would be included in the collection and led the research topic selection and scope definition. |
| Hunter | Object Preservation Manager | Hunter was responsible for overseeing the storage space and documents folder, establishing the collection's file naming standard, and ensuring backup copies are available. |
| Anna | Metadata Manager | Anna was responsible for managing the spreadsheet and ensuring our metadata follows the Dublin Core and CollectionBuilder requirements. |
| Conner | Repository Manager | Conner was responsible for taking notes at our meetings, leading technical troubleshooting, and managed our GitHub repository. |

### Anticipated Data

The DMP should describe the types of data produced during the project and matters such as:
include all file types used in the site, list license selected for site and discuss licenses groupings for digital objects
Include a brief description of data volume in MB here, grouped by file type
the way your data was generated or acquired
document the data associated with the project:

### Documentation and Metadata

What type of metadata will accompany this data? Where and how can users access this metadata?
Hint: Your data dictionary, once completed, is excellent documentation! Where and how do you plan on provide it to your audience?

### Storage and Backup

Describe resources, repositories, and platforms used to preserve your data during the project.
Hint: This should include Google Drive, GitHub, and any storage on your personal computers.

### Data Sharing

How will you share your data? What will you make available?
Could others want to reuse your data? In what ways?
Do you plan on archiving your data in an external repository? (This is not a requirement!)

### Period of Data Retention

This section should address how long your group plans to maintain each component of the project before and after it has been submitted for grading.
If you plan to maintain the project after the term ends, what is your contingency plan if a component of the project goes down?

### Licensing and Ethical Issues

Use this section to outline the intellectual property rights of your created material.  What are the terms under which others may use these materials? If your data and products raise any potential ethics issues, use this section to address those matters.

### Appendix: Data Dictionary

| Field | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| objectid | A unique string with no spaces or special characters that will be used as an ID in the website. Records without an objectid will not be displayed in the collection. Records with non-unique objectid will be overwritten. |
| title | A name given to the resource. |
| date | A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource. |
| description | An account of the resource. |
| subject | The topic of the resource. |
| location | A geographic location to which the resource applies. |
| source | The source field designates a related source collection or resource from which the object is derived. This field is especially relevant for digitized archival collections. In such a situation, the name of the physical archival collection would be the input for this field. |
| identifier | An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context. |
| type | Distinguishes between types of image, sound, text, etc. using a one- or two-value input. |
| format | The digital file format of the resource or media type. |
| rights | Information about rights held in and over the resource. |
| rightsstatement | A standardized rights statement, presented as a creativecommons.org URI or rightsstatements.org URI |
| display_template | Sets the template type used for the Item page and is used in logic to choose representations in other pages. If blank the object will default to a generic item page. |
| image_alt_text | An appropriate textual description of the image_small representation of the item. The alt text corresponds to the image_small (not necessarily the file at object_location). This value will be used as the “alt” value of the image element, which is important for accessibility. |
| address | The web address to the object in the GLAM. |
| cataloger | The group member that input the object's metadata. |
| citation | MLA citation of the object. |
| filename | This is the digital object's filename, including the name itself as well as the object's file extension. For externally hosted items, this may be a full URL. |
| structure | A metadata field our group created in order to have a more general category for objects to fit into. |

Your data dictionary is a key to your metadata. It is organized as a table documenting fields in your group’s CollectionBuilder spreadsheet.
Your data dictionary should have as many items as used fields in your CollectionBuilder metadata spreadsheet.
You do not need to alter the standard definitions of fields required by CollectionBuilder.
Did you created your own fields? Use the location field in a specific context? Have a naming standard for your items? This is the place to (briefly) document those decisions.
